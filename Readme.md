# How to merge cells horizontally in GridView

## This example is obsolete and starting with version 17.1 there is no easy way to implement this behavior

GridControl doesn't support horizontal cell merging. Instead, we recommend using our <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/windowsforms/12063/controls-and-libraries/spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</a> that supports cell merging out of the box:<br><br><a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/windowsforms/15416/controls-and-libraries/spreadsheet/examples/cells/how-to-merge-cells-or-split-merged-cells">How to: Merge Cells or Split Merged Cells</a> <br>

## ***If the Spreadsheet control does not suit you, we will be happy to find the most appropriate solution for you if you describe your real-life scenario. Just click <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Create">here</a> to submit a ticket to our Support Center.***
